# Softsquirrel CHIP-8 implementation
Softsquirrels really cool and super-duper efficient CHIP-8 implentation for Windows.

## Usage
1. [Download](https://github.com/Squirrelcoding/sschip8/releases/).
2. Run `.\sschip8 <PATH TO .ch8 FILE>` in cmd or Powershell

## v1.0.1
- fixed a bug.

### Differences between other implementations
- There ~~may~~ will be a lot of bugs
- Whenever a program pauses for a keypress, you have to flush it to the standard input  manually by pressing `enter`

## Why Windows?
Softsquirrel is known for developing software for usually only Linux, however this time it's on Windows. But this time it's on Windows, what gives? The reason we have chosen Windows is that: we didn't. We *would* have gone with Linux but using the Windows API (which is used for some stuff) was much easier than working with the Linux Kernel/X11.
